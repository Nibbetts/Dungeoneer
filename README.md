Procedurally generated dungeons

I'm honestly just building this for fun, because procedural generation fascinates me, and because I can. It may turn into a game if it goes far enough.

Originally the idea came from trying to build a dungeon layout in which to play the board/card game Munchkin, though there are some balance issues without modifying Munchkin significantly.
